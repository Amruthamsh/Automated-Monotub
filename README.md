# Automated-Monotub

My code for the automated monotub project (languages include arduino and google apps script). This project was for the 13th National Level Techno Exhibition held at Dr. Ambedkar Institute of Technology, and was presented on 13th April, 2023 which won us the third place. 

# Revolutionizing Mushroom Cultivation: The Benefits of an Automated Monotub

Mushrooms are a valuable source of nutrition, with many species offering numerous health benefits. However, traditional mushroom cultivation can be a challenging and time-consuming process, requiring careful monitoring of temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels. To overcome these challenges, we have developed an automated cultivation box incorporating Arduino microcontroller that streamlines the mushroom growing process while ensuring optimal conditions for growth under any given external climatic conditions.

Our cultivation box incorporates CO2, temperature, and humidity sensors that are controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. This microcontroller constantly monitors and adjusts the environment within the box to create the ideal growing conditions for mushrooms. By controlling these factors, our box can minimize the risk of contamination and ensure that mushrooms grow quickly and uniformly. The dark phase and fruiting phase of the mushroom growing process can be accommodated in the same box while in traditional methods itâ€™s grown separately. To test the effectiveness of our cultivation box, we grew oyster mushrooms such as pink and white. These mushrooms are a popular choice for home cultivation due to their ease of growing and excellent flavor. We found that our automated cultivation box provided consistent and reliable results, producing high-quality mushrooms with minimal effort.
